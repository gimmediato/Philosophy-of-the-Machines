## 📖 About This Manifesto

This manifesto defines the *Philosophy of the Machines* — a new discipline for understanding how artificial agents reshape cognition, decision-making, and ethical responsibility. It introduces a formal, philosophical, and business-aligned model (Δ–η–ζ) for evaluating AI systems beyond technical performance.
